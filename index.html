    <h1>Greg Hawthorne</h1>
    
    <p>Be unconventional, respectful and kind. Curiousity is the fountain of youth, drink heartily from it. Work hard, stay humble. Take on new challenges everyday and above all recognize the absurdities and beauty on earth. Laugh loud and laugh often. Never cease to grow as a humanoid and give more than you take. These are a few of the principles I try to live by.</p>
